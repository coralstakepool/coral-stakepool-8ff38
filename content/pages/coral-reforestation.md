    subtitle: >-
      To keep it simple - fragments of an existing coral colony are cut &
      planted somewhere else, giving the colony a new living environment in
      which it can multiply and further grow.

          At the beginning of each project, fragments of opportunity (coral
          fragments that have broken off naturally by waves, storms, etc. but
          still alive) are collected and transplanted onto solid structures
          placed in favourable locations for their growth.

        subtitle: "The corals are suspended in the middle of the water column with a constant stream of nutrients passing by and closer to the sunlight.\_ Both of these factors means the corals are in optimum conditions to grow."
        content: >
          During the entire nursing process, divers regularly clean the new
          corals and the nursery beds: removing algae, sediment and predators
          like snails and starfish.

        subtitle: >-
          Outplanting is the process of attaching the corals back to the reef,
          where they will be able to continue growing and then start
          reproducing.
        content: "After approximately 3 to 9 months the corals in the nurseries have grown sufficiently.  The corals are moved carefully to the area where we plan to reforest, to regenerate damaged sections of the reef and strengthen resilience. The corals are reattached to reefs piece by piece with cement, zip ties, and nails.\_\n"

          In the last 5 years we deployed 8 artificial reefs on Zanzibar. We
          made different structures with Reef Balls and limestone. On all
          structures we planted juvenile corals from the farm, leading to the
          production of 50,000 juvenile corals.

          Coral Reef Care is a Dutch foundation thatâ€™s mission is the
          conservation and protection of marine ecosystems, in particular coral
          reefs.


          Our work consists of creating public awareness and organize local
          marine conservation projects. CRC always works together with a local
          NGO or research organization that has proven durability and
          effectiveness over the years. This collaboration can result in a wide
          variety of activities such as the restoration of damaged reefs,
          removal of lost fishing nets on coral reefs, campaigns to reduce
          plastic waste, creation of artificial reefs, deployment of mooring
          buoys, creation of No Take Zones and the protection of specific marine
          species.

Indeed, they had to go fishing further and further away in order to meet the food and economic needs of their families.\n\nIn 4 years, our efforts have led to the protection of a 1,2 HA marine area, 40 000 corals transplanted, 30 times more fish on our restored area and the creation of 30 local jobs.\n\n\\---\n\nCoral Guardian is a French NGO\_acting internationally, and founded in 2012, which aims to\_protect coral reef ecosystems\_by\_implicating local communities\_and\_raising awareness\_among the general public.\n\n[Coral Guardian](https://www.coralguardian.org/)\n"

      50% of Coral's stake pool profits will be donated to Coral NGOs. With $500
      donated, we can support the growth and planting of 60 to 100 coral
      fragments. **Together, we can help restore coral reefs**, the most
      important ecosystem in our oceans and all the marine life that depends on
      it.
